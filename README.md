# âš¡ Microservice Deployment Pipeline

A modern **microservice architecture** built with **FastAPI**, **background workers**, and **PostgreSQL**, all orchestrated with **Docker Compose** and a **CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions**.

This project is designed to showcase:
- **API-first design** (FastAPI microservice).
- **Worker processes** for background tasks.
- **Database integration** (PostgreSQL).
- **Automated testing** with Pytest.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment** (CI/CD) with Docker and GitHub Actions.

## **ðŸš€ Features**
- **FastAPI microservice** with health-check endpoints.
- **Background worker** (simulating queue/task processing).
- **PostgreSQL database** running as a container.
- **Docker & docker-compose** for multi-container orchestration.
- **CI/CD** pipeline that:
  - Installs dependencies.
  - Runs all tests.
  - Builds Docker images.
  - Pushes images to Docker Hub.

## **ðŸ”§ How to Run**

### **Run locally (API only)**
```bash
cd service_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

### **Run everything with Docker**

Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Services:

- API: http://localhost:8000

- Worker: Runs in background (logs visible in terminal).

- Database: PostgreSQL on localhost:5432 (user: user, pass: password).

## Run Tests
```bash
pytest
#This will execute all tests in both service_api and service_worker.
```

## **ðŸ“¦ CI/CD Pipeline**
The pipeline in `.github/workflows/ci_cd.yml` will:
1. Run unit tests on every push.
2. Build Docker images for both the API and the Worker.
3. Push the images to Docker Hub (when secrets `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` are configured).

## **ðŸ”¥ Why This Project Rocks**

This repository is a **production-ready template** for building modern microservice-based applications. It demonstrates:

- **Clean separation of concerns** â€“ each service (API, worker, database) has its own responsibility.
- **Scalable architecture** â€“ easily extendable by adding new microservices or components.
- **Automated testing & CI/CD** â€“ ensures quality with Pytest and seamless deployments through GitHub Actions.
- **Battle-tested tech stack** â€“ built using FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL, and other real-world tools.

**Examples of apps with similar architecture:**  
- **Uber/Didi** â€“ APIs handle ride requests while background workers process payments and notifications.  
- **Spotify** â€“ APIs serve playlists and user data, while workers manage recommendations and heavy data processing.  
- **Amazon** â€“ separate services for cart management, product catalog, and payment workflows.

## **ðŸ›  Tech Stack**
- **FastAPI** â€“ for the REST API.
- **Pytest** â€“ for testing.
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ database container.
- **Docker & docker-compose** â€“ container orchestration.
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ CI/CD automation.
